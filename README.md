# Virtual Megus: an experiment with procedural music

[Listen to Virtual Megus](https://megus.org/virtual-megus/)

Procedural music is one of my long-time interests. Virtual Megus is the attempt to create a system
which plays neverending electronic music. I’m not into abstract noises, so my goal is to
achieve pleasant-sounding results. As a musician, I obviously have some biases, and my system
will probably have them too, hence the name — Virtual Megus.

I'm going to document my progress in [my blog](https://megus.org) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sugem).
