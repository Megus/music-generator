# Virtual Megus: an experiment with procedural music

For years I wanted to experiment with procedural music. In August 2019 I decided that the time has come. I also wanted to learn WebAudio API, that's why it runs in a browser (Google Chrome only now, I may add support for other browsers in the future).

My goal is to create a system, which can play infinite electronic music. I'm not into abstract noises, so I'm trying to achieve pleasant to listen results.

I'm going to document my progress in [my blog](https://megus.org) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sugem).
