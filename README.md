# Virtual Megus: an experiment with procedural music

[Listen to Virtual Megus](https://megus.org/virtual-megus/)

For years I wanted to experiment with procedural music. In August 2019, I decided that the time has come. I also wanted to learn WebAudio API; that's why it runs in a browser (Google Chrome only now, I may add support for other browsers in the future).

My goal is to create a system, which can play neverending electronic music. I'm not into abstract noises, so I'm trying to achieve pleasant to listen to results.

I'm going to document my progress in [my blog](https://megus.org) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sugem).
